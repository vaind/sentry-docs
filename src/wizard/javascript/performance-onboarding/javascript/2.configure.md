#### Configure

We also support alternate [installation methods](/platforms/javascript/install/).

`init` the Sentry Browser SDK as soon as possible during your page load:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";
import { BrowserTracing } from "@sentry/tracing";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [new BrowserTracing()],

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for performance monitoring.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

We recommend adjusting the value of `tracesSampleRate` in production. Learn more about configuring sampling in our [full documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/sampling/).
